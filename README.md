This little Python program is a parser of Czech hockey website "http://www.hokej.cz/". I live in Ostrava and I'd like to know the results of local team games. So the program parse a webpage with all matches and save only Vitkovice's games to a csv file. 

Note: For some reason Microsoft Excel doesn't open this csv file correctly, I really don't know why, but Google Sheets open it properly.
